The Big Bang Theory in Quran,"The theory of the origin of the universe is one of the most noteworthy scientific things mentioned in the Quran. Until 100 years ago, it was believed that the universe has no creator and has always existed. But Albert Einstein, during his field equations study, challenged this belief when he presented the theory that the universe is an expanding force that is growing like a balloon. Later, a mathematician and Belgian priest proposed that this expansion must have begun from an initial and dense point.","""the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit, before We clove them asunder"""
The Big Crunch Theory in Quran,The Big Crunch theory that predicts how the universe will end is yet another scientific thing the Quran details. The idea based on Einstein’s general relativity theory talks about how the universe that began with the big bang will be eventually destroyed as its consequence. It is a hypothetical scenario that details the fate of the universe and explains that the expansion will eventually reverse at some point in time and the cosmos will collapse.,emember the day when we shall roll up the heavens like the rolling up of written scrolls by a scribe.
Oceanic Division mentions,"The meeting of two oceans is termed conflux. When two seas meet, their waters retain individual properties like temperature, color, and density. At a point of conflux, one can see two different water bodies running side by side. Even though this discovery is recent, the holy Quran informed the readers about this phenomenon in its 55:19-20 passage. The scientific fact in Quran is stated as “he released the two seas, meeting [side by side], between them, is a barrier [so] neither of them transgresses.”","“he released the two seas, meeting [side by side], between them, is a barrier [so] neither of them transgresses.”"
Embryology in Quran,"Embryology is a branch of biology concerned with the study of fertilization and embryo development. The central religious text, at one point, talks about embryology and states a significant scientific fact in Quran. It says, “We created man from an extract of clay. Then we made him as a drop in a place of settlement, firmly fixed. Then we made the drop into an Alaqah (blood clot), then we made the Alaqah into a Mudghah…” (Quran 23:12-14). Here the word ‘Alaqah’ can be defined as a leech, blood clot, or something suspended in the air. According to science, a foetus gets nutrients and oxygen from the mother. In this sense, it is not unlike a leech that sucks blood. Also, in the early stages, the foetus stays stationary and the blood does not flow, which renders it similar to a blood clot. Lastly, in the womb, the baby hangs from the uterus wall by the placenta and lies suspended.","“We created man from an extract of clay. Then we made him as a drop in a place of settlement, firmly fixed. Then we made the drop into an Alaqah (blood clot), then we made the Alaqah into a Mudghah…”"
Iron Within Meteorites,"According to M.E. Walrath, iron is not an element that was naturally present on Earth. Studies suggest that a billion years ago, a meteorite struck Earth. This meteorite had iron on it, and when it exploded after coming in contact with our planet, Earth got iron. This scientific fact in Quran is stated in passage 57:25 as “we sent down iron with its great inherent strength and its many benefits for humankind”.",“we sent down iron with its great inherent strength and its many benefits for humankind”.
Formation Of Clouds,"Unlike today, when children in elementary school read about the formation of clouds, in 609 C.E., this was not the case. But, the Quran still aptly describes the process of the formation of clouds. The book says, “Have you not seen how Allah makes the clouds move gently, then joins them together, then makes them into a stack, and then you see the rain come out of it?” This is an accurate description of what actually happens. In reality, the small clouds are pushed by the winds (moved gently), and the ones that are near each other amalgamate. At this point, a vertical updraft happens and the upper part of the cloud expands up in the sky. As a result, different parts of the cloud are raised to divergent points and look as if many clouds are piled on top of each other (stacking). The mention of this scientific fact in the Quran is ahead of time as this study only took place in the past two centuries.","“Have you not seen how Allah makes the clouds move gently, then joins them together, then makes them into a stack, and then you see the rain come out of it?” "
Pain Receptors in Quran,"For a long time, it was believed that the sense of feeling and pain is because of the brain. But, a scientific study recently found out that our skin features pain receptors due to which we feel pain and agony. Surprisingly, the holy text of the Quran hinted at this occurrence a long time ago. It states, “We shall send those who reject our revelations to the (hell) fire. When their skins have been burned away, we shall replace them with new ones so that they may continue to feel the pain.” This passage clearly suggests that we feel pain because of our skin.","“We shall send those who reject our revelations to the (hell) fire. When their skins have been burned away, we shall replace them with new ones so that they may continue to feel the pain.”"
Internal Waves In The Ocean,"Oceanographers while studying water bodies discovered that the belief of waves only occur on the surface of the ocean is wrong. In reality, the waves are present internally underneath the surface of the water and are created when the lower part of the oceanic body faces an obstacle. This barrier creates a disturbance in the water body and leads to oscillation. The central religious text of Islam that details several secrets and facts about the depth of oceans also talks about this phenomenon. One of the nine scientific facts in the Quran talks about the internal waves of the ocean and says that “it is covered by waves, above which are waves, above which are clouds.”","“it is covered by waves, above which are waves, above which are clouds.”"
The Frontal Lobe,"In the Quran, there is a story of a man named Abu Jahl, an oppressive leader. To warn him, Allah said, “No indeed! if he does not stop, we will seize him by the forehead, his lying, sinful forehead.” Now, according to the followers of Islam, there is a deeper meaning behind this statement. Modern research into anatomy suggests that the prefrontal area of the human brain deals with planning, aggression, and motivation. So, it is the part of our brain which is responsible for lying. Muslims believe that the mention of the forehead is specific and intentional and it is another scientific fact stated in the Quran.","“No indeed! if he does not stop, we will seize him by the forehead, his lying, sinful forehead.”"
Sun’s orbit,"The belief that the Sun is stationary was widespread amongst astronomers until the 20th century. It is now a well-established scientific fact that the Sun is not stationary, but is moving in an orbit around the centre of our Milky Way galaxy. “It is He who created night and day, the sun and the moon, each floating in its orbit.”[Quran, 21:33]","“It is He who created night and day, the sun and the moon, each floating in its orbit.”"
Mountains,"A book titled ‘Earth’ by Geophysicist Frank Press (Earth (ISBN 0716717433) by Press, Frank, Siever, Raymond. W.H. Freeman, c1986.)  explains that mountains are like stakes, and are buried deep under the surface of the earth. Mount Everest, the height of which is approximately 9 km above ground, has a root deeper than 125 km.   “Did we not make the earth a resting place? and the mountains as stakes?”[Quran, 78:6-7]",“Did we not make the earth a resting place? and the mountains as stakes?”
Universe expanding,"The fact that the universe is expanding was discovered in the last century. The physicist Stephen Hawking in his book ‘A Brief History of Time’ writes, “The discovery that the universe is expanding was one of the great intellectual revolutions of the 20th century.” “And it is We who have built the universe with [Our creative] power and keep expanding it.”[ Quran, 51:47]",“And it is We who have built the universe with [Our creative] power and keep expanding it.”
Light in the Moon is merely a Reflection,"It is known that the sun is a star that generates intense heat and light by its internal combustion, and that the moon which does not give off light itself, merely reflects the light received from the sun.
 
The Qur’an testifies the above fact:

“Blessed is the One Who placed the constellations in heaven and placed in it a lamp (SIRAJ) and a moon, giving light (MUNIIRA)”. (25:61)
 
Here the moon is defined as a body that gives reflection of light (Muniira), while the sun is compared to a blazing lamp or torch (Siraj).","“Blessed is the One Who placed the constellations in heaven and placed in it a lamp (SIRAJ) and a moon, giving light"
High Altitude,"It is infact a highly common place reflection on the discomfort experienced at high altitude, which increases the higher one climbs, that is expressed in the Qur’an: “Those whom God wills to guide, He opens their breast to Islam. While those whom He wills to let straying, He makes their breath closed and constricted, as if they had to climb up the skies”. (6:125) Who informed the Prophet that by climbing up in the skies, the pressure increases and breathing becomes difficult?","“Those whom God wills to guide, He opens their breast to Islam. While those whom He wills to let straying, He makes their breath closed and constricted, as if they had to climb up the skies”."
Honey Bees,"“Your Lord inspired the (female) bee, choose your dwelling in the hills, in the trees and in what (man) build. Eat of all fruit and follow the ways of your Lord in humility. From within their bodies comes a liquid of different colours where is cure for men”. (16:68-69)
 
The Qur’an refers that the worker-bees who are searching for food are females. The verbs used in Arabic refer to female bees. This is very amazing. For all along, until only recently, people imagined that the “soldier-bees” were males.","“Your Lord inspired the (female) bee, choose your dwelling in the hills, in the trees and in what (man) build. Eat of all fruit and follow the ways of your Lord in humility. From within their bodies comes a liquid of different colours where is cure for men”"
Role of Wind,"The Qur’an also mentions the role and operation of an important factor in the bringing of things to fruition: the wind.

“We have sent the winds as a means of insemination and impregnation, and then sent down rain from the heavens.” (15:22).

In this verse, the Qur’an unveils another a great mystery of creation, the fundamental role played by the wind in the fertilization of plants.","“We have sent the winds as a means of insemination and impregnation, and then sent down rain from the heavens.” (15:22)."
In Pairs,"It is only recently that researchers have come aware of insemination in plants and learned that every living being including plants comes into existence as the result of the merging of a male and female parts.
 
In verses that are totally free of ambiguity, the noble Qur’an, sets forth clearly the principle of gender in the gender world, together with the existence of male and female parts even in plants.

“Do they not look at the earth, where we created the plants in pairs”. (26:7).","“Do they not look at the earth, where we created the plants in pairs”"
Production of Milk in Animals,"The Qur’an describes the factors which give rise to milk in animals in a way that is entirely compatible with the data of modern science. This is what God’s book has to say:

“There is in truth for you a lesson in your animals and flocks. We give you to drink a pure milk derived from that which is contained in their bodies, from the merging of what is held in their intestines with blood. The drinking of that is then made easy for those who drink it.” (16:66).
 
Dr. Bucaille writes in his book:
“From a scientific point of view, physiological notions must be called upon to grasp the meaning of this verse. The substances that ensure the general nutrition of the body come from chemical transformations which occur along the length of the digestive tract. These substances come from the contents of the intestine. On arrival in the intestine at the appropriate stage of chemical transformation, they pass through its wall and towards the systemic circulation (of blood)...... This very precise concept is the result of the discoveries made in the chemistry and physiology of the digestive system. It was totally unknown at the time of the Prophet Muhammad and has been understood only in recent times.”","“There is in truth for you a lesson in your animals and flocks. We give you to drink a pure milk derived from that which is contained in their bodies, from the merging of what is held in their intestines with blood. The drinking of that is then made easy for those who drink it.” (16:66)."
Force of Gravity,"We know that before the time of Newton, that great scientific personality, no one was aware of the force of gravity. Newton proved that the falling of objects to earth, the rotation of the moon and the Venus, the motion of the planets, and other instances of attraction are all subject to the single law, the law of universal gravity.
 
The Qur’an describes the above mentioned gravitational force as ‘invisible pillars’:

“God it is Who raised up the heavenly bodies to invisible pillars .....” (13:2).
 
In conveying this scientific truth, the Qur’an has used an expression that is comprehensible for the men of all ages. Are these ‘unseen pillars’, which prevent the planets from colliding with each other or falling, anything other than the mysterious and invisible force of universal gravity, a law to which the Creator of the universe has subjected all of the heavenly bodies?",“God it is Who raised up the heavenly bodies to invisible pillars .....”
Orbits,"It is He who created the night and the day, the sun and the moon, each swimming in an orbit. The word yasbaḥūn (یَسبَحون) is an Arabic word that means motion by a moving body. This could be movement of the body on the ground or swimming in water. However, when we want to translate it as regards a celestial body, it means “to travel with its own motion.” 5","It is He who created the night and the day, the sun and the moon, each swimming in an orbit."
Rotation of the Earth,"He created the heavens and the earth with consummate wisdom. He winds the night over the day, and winds the day over the night, and He has disposed the sun and the moon, each moving for a specified term. Indeed, He is the All-mighty, the All-forgiver!

This winding the day over the night and winding the night over the day depicts a rotational movement of the earth. God states this fact long before astronomers discovered the rotation of the earth around its own axis. This is yet another proof of the veracity of the Quran and the religion of Islam.","He created the heavens and the earth with consummate wisdom. He winds the night over the day, and winds the day over the night, and He has disposed the sun and the moon, each moving for a specified term. Indeed, He is the All-mighty, the All-forgiver!"
The Solar Apex,"The sun runs on to its place of rest: That is the ordaining of the All-mighty, the All-knowing. 6

Modern science has proven that the entire solar system is moving in a circulatory motion around a specific location towards a specific point. Astronomers have called this point, the solar apex.","The sun runs on to its place of rest: That is the ordaining of the All-mighty, the All-knowing."
Water Cycle,"it was not so until the sixteenth century when an explanation for the water cycle was given. People before used to believe that winds thrust the water of the oceans into the continents, which then returned to the oceans by means of the great abyss. The Quran had a correct explanation for and description of the water cycle more than 14 centuries ago and it is completely in line with modern science.","Have you not seen that Allah sends down water from the sky, then He conducts it through the ground as springs. Then He brings forth with it crops of diverse hues. Then they wither and you see them turn yellow. Then He turns them into chaff. There is indeed a lesson in that for those who possess intellect."
Physiology,"This is very intriguing indeed. A thousand years before the discovery of the blood circulatory system, and how it nourishes the internal organs, as well as about thirteen centuries before the digestive system was discovered, God explains in this verse how milk is made in the cattle. That is, by the bloodstream going into the mammary glands and the digestive system nourishing the internal organs. The Quran is truly the word of God, not the word of Prophet Muhammad who was an untaught man.","There is indeed a lesson for you in the cattle: We give you a drink pleasant to those who drink, pure milk, which is in their bellies, between [intestinal] waste and blood."

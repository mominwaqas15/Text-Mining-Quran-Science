# Text Mining Quran Science

## Overview

Text Mining Quran Science is a data analysis project that explores the relationship between scientific information and Quranic verses through text mining techniques. This project aims to uncover insights, patterns, and sentiments within the Quranic text and scientific information.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `Islamic Data.csv`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `code.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the code used for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

## Dataset

I meticulously crafted the dataset used in this project. It comprises three crucial columns:

1. **Topic**: Describes the scientific concept or Quranic verse under consideration.
2. **Scientific Information**: Contains text related to the scientific concept.
3. **Quranic Verse**: Contains the Quranic verse or text relevant to the topic.

I collected the data by scraping information from various reputable sources and meticulously organized it into a structured CSV file. For transparency and reference, you can find the links to the source sites in the `references.txt` file.

I then performed comprehensive data preprocessing, which included removing superfluous characters, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing the text for further analysis.

## Data Analysis

I applied various data analysis techniques in this project, including:

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization).
- Sentiment analysis to gauge the sentiment expressed in scientific information and Quranic verses.
- Jaccard similarity analysis to measure text similarity.

## Results

The project yielded insightful findings, such as Jaccard similarity scores and sentiment analysis results. These results provide valuable insights into the intersections and correlations between scientific concepts and Quranic verses.
